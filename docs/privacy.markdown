### Information Collection and Use
The App does not collect any personal information from users. All data generated or entered by users is stored locally on the device with the option for the user to export it themselves. Data is not transmitted to us or any third parties.

### Data Storage
Any data generated or entered by users, including but not limited to text, statistics, or other content, is stored locally on the user's device with the option for the user to export it themselves. We do not have access to this data and do not store it on our servers.

### Security
We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information. All user generated data is encrypted and stored locally, with the addition of a user made pin. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
